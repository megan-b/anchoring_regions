This repository supports the paper titled "Identifying individual anchoring regions
by mining public transport smart card data" and contains additional supporting charts and information as an appendix to the paper.


## Using this code

Two datasets are required: journeys (containing the tag on and off transactions for a public transport network) and stops (the list of stop IDs, as used in the journeys data, and their corresponding names and coordinates).

For confidentiality reasons the original data cannot be provided. A synthetic dataset will instead be provided for use, but note the results will not be exactly reproducible.

Two other minor updates to the code will be required in order for it to run - a directory string to where the data is saved, and a Mapbox token to generate the maps. Mapbox provides further information on generating access tokens [[link]](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/getting-started/access-tokens/ "here").

## Supporting charts

Since the results are not directly reproducible, throughout the code there are references to figure numbers and the plots generated from this code with the original data are included as static images here.
